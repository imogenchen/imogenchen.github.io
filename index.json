Many social welfare organisation are devoting efforts to support them and trying to dissolve obstacles with loves. However, general public has little knowledge of the needs of disability which leads them to reject those services to locate in communities.\nGuting Sheltered Workshop（古亭工坊）is social welfare service for children with intelligent development disorder. In the past, they disclose little information for general public and only open for filtered visitation; even neighbourhood has little understanding of its service. To raise public awareness and acceptance, Taiwan Social and Family Affairs Administration (衛生福利部社會及家庭署) decided to work with Careus Foundation (喜憨兒基金會) by holding open days at Guting Sheltered Workshop. Therefore, renovating its visitor routine and making intriguing visit experience are critical.\nChallenge How might we create an inviting environment that make visitors understand what workshop serve in a short time while still meets internal staff daily needs with consideration of disability limitation.\nSolution Create a narrative to shape facility into a unique “Guting Space Colony” and introduce service touchpoints with distinctive visual assets to make it replicable for other facilities and long-term maintenance. Also, personify disability behaviours into cartoon characters like “Miss Repetitive”, “ Mr. Shy”, “Mr. Loudly” etc., to make visit to workshop memorable and educable. Process 1. User Research: Beginning with immersive user research, we conducted a 3-day field observation and holistic stakeholder interviews, included social workers, caregivers and parents of children with disability, and external stakeholders such as property manager and neighbouring business owners. A diary study was deployed to record how disability, as target of service, think of facility service, activities and spaces. 2. Design Strategy:   Functional Area Division: We discovered the building structure is the biggest barrier to optimise visiting flow; therefore, dividing facility into functional areas will help lay the groundwork.\n  Visualised Information Architecture: In order to demonstrate better visiting experience, we categorised service touchpoints into four groups: signs, instructions, announcements and labels with modular visuals.\n  3. Co-Creation: We proposed two design directions — applying colour psychology into environmental design to represent different areas of facility, or designing a custom story to demonstrate holistic experience. Facility members are invited to choose their design preferences and to voice questions. Children also participated in co-creation session to crystal our idea, suggesting the elements and titles for storytelling themed approach. 4. Prototyping: Our final task before implementation was to verify our improvement with facility members. A prototyping session was hosted to realise if the new experience design qualify its adoption. Furthermore, visitor tour usually led by disability assisted by social workers. We prototyped environment design and introduced visiting flow to ensure a smooth walk-through of future visit led by members. 5. Implementation: This project is partnered with ONEDOR \u0026amp; DreamVok\n","permalink":"https://imogenchen.github.io/work/revitalise_guting_sheltered_workshop/","tags":["Social Innovation","Ethnography","In-Depth Interview","Diary Study"],"title":"Revitalise Guting Sheltered Workshop"},{"categories":["Coding"],"contents":"Introduction The pandemic has impacted the global economy and people\u0026rsquo;s livelihoods. How is coronavirus affecting the nations and people? What countries are worst-affected by Covid-19? This project presented data analysis in python, turning Covid-19 into a data visualisation.\nStarting at the end of 2019, some websites such as John Hopkins University, began collecting data from all around the world. To make this project simple to tackle, I decided to work with the Coronavirus Covid19 API published by postman.com, which consists of the summary of cumulative confirmed cases in each country updates daily.\nThis project uses python libraries such as Json, Pandas and Matplotlib to clean, analyse and visualise dataset. In the end of project, two data visualisation will be presented:\n Case 1: Top 10 countries with most confirmed cases. Case 2: Mapping the death rate of the worst-affected country.   Case 1: Top 10 countries with most confirmed cases 1. Importing Data\nFirstly, accessing the Covid-19 JSON format downloaded by date of April 2020 from Coronavirus APIs. A quick investigation reveals that the JSON file is structured within \u0026lsquo;ID\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Message\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Global\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Countries\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Date\u0026rsquo; objects. \u0026lsquo;Countries\u0026rsquo; which consists of total confirmed cases is what we need, so we filtered out the specific attributes and values.\n(Note: install JSONView chrome extension to get easy-to-read json tree with chrome browser)\nimport json import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt with open('covid19_summary_200423.json', 'r') as read_file: data = json.load(read_file) country_data = data['Countries'] 2. Cleaning Data\npandas.DataFrame converts the number of rows and columns to DataFrame. Using loc to select data columns by labels: \u0026lsquo;Country\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;TotalConfirmed\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Total Deaths\u0026rsquo;. The following table displays 192 countries with confirmed/death numbers in alphabetical order; therefore, our next step is to reorder the list by the numbers of confirmed cases.\ndf = pd.DataFrame(country_data) df = df.loc[:, ['Country', 'TotalConfirmed', 'TotalDeaths']] We use sort_values fo sort dataframe by a specific column\u0026rsquo;s value, ranking the confirmed case from most to least numbers. The pandas loc method allow us to take only index labels and returns the first 10 highly affected nations.\nFor additional information, we also apply eval method to calculate the death rate.\ndf = df.sort_values(by='TotalConfirmed', ascending = False) df.index = range(len(df)) df = df.loc[0:9] df.eval('DeathRate = TotalDeaths/TotalConfirmed', inplace = True) date = data['Date'] print(df) print(date) 3. Visualising Data\nUsing matplotlib.pyplot to visualise data into bar chart. The df1 object demonstrates the top 10 countries with most confirmed cases whilst df2 displays the death rate as reference.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt df.loc[0, 'Country'] = 'United States' df.loc[6, 'Country'] = 'Russia' df.loc[7, 'Country'] = 'Iran' df1 = df.loc[:, ['Country', 'TotalConfirmed', 'TotalDeaths']] df1 = df1.set_index('Country') df1.plot.bar(stacked = True) plt.xticks(rotation=20) plt.tick_params(labelsize = 7) plt.title('Covid19 Top 10 Country') plt.savefig('Covid19_top10_country.png') df2 = df.loc[:, ['Country', 'DeathRate']] df2 = df2.set_index('Country') df2.plot.bar(color = 'r') plt.xticks(rotation=20) plt.tick_params(labelsize = 7) plt.title('Covid19 Death Rate by Top 10 Country') plt.savefig('Covid19_death_rate_by_top10_country.png') plt.show() Case 2: Mapping the death rate of the worst-affected country The result above reveals United States is the worst-affected country, accounting for 838,963 total confirmed cases by the date of April 23.\n1. Importing Data\nWe download data by country and status: \u0026lsquo;Covid19_US_confirmed.json\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Covid19_US_Deaths.json\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Covid19_US_Recovered.json, which recorded data from January to May 2020.\nA pre-created template allows us to convert data into dataframe more efficiently.\nimport pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import bokeh template = 'Covid19_US_{}.json' statuses = ['Confirmed','Deaths','Recovered'] dfs = dict() for status in statuses: df = pd.read_json(template.format(status)) dfs[status] = df Next, integrate three dataframe into one table by concat method. The following picture shows a table with 312 rows after concatenation.\ndfall = pd.concat(dfs.values()) 2. Cleaning Data\nBefore moving forward, we use dt.date method to delete unneeded time data.\nData is often stored in stacked format, listing every single observation. Our final step before visualisation is to reshape stacked (long) format into unstacked (wide) format by using pivot whilst setting up \u0026lsquo;Date\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Status\u0026rsquo; as index.\ndfall['Date'] = dfall['Date'].dt.date dfall = dfall.pivot('Date', 'Status', 'Cases') 3. Visualising Data\nA run chart helps us to study data for pattern over a specific period of time. Using plot to draw a trend line, we‘re seeing a upward trend that confirmed cases in United States is increasing by a large amount.\ndfall.plot() plt.xticks(rotation=30) plt.tick_params(labelsize = 3) plt.savefig('Covid19_US_trend.png') plt.show() ","permalink":"https://imogenchen.github.io/work/covid-19/","tags":["Python"],"title":" Covid-19 Data Visualisation in Python"},{"categories":["User Research"],"contents":"Introduction Discovering information from end-users is important for leading new product and service. Contextmapping Skill is one of generative design method that underly needs, motivations and dreams from users.\nResearch revealed that people in the Netherlands have high brand stickiness to their first bank account. Therefore, the youngsters aged 13-18 have great potentials for being prospective customers for our client ABN AMRO Bank. Tutored by design agency Muzus, we helped our client to explore what are the needs and wishes of the youngsters and what are the triggers of spending/earning money in daily life.\nChallenge How can ABN AMRO best approach youngsters and engage them in banking service.\nSolution Delivering the youngsters' attitudes toward money through tangible deliverables like personas, wallets and life journeys for ABN AMRO bank to initiate their first approach to teens.\nProcess 1. Assumption Map\nIn the preparation phase, we created a Assumption Map of our thought on teenagers by brainstorming. Topics like families, behaviours, social connections and spending helped us to formulate an image of user groups.\n2. Participant Recruitment\nNext, we searched teenagers who fit the profile from the teams' personal network. Eight youngsters from diverse backgrounds and education levels at age 13-16 were recruited.\n2. Sensitising Process\nAll participants received a sensitising package consisted of a workbook, pencils, stickers and chocolate coins. A workbook with daily assignment were well conceived by us to make participants be aware of the experience related to topics before session and enhanced the contribution they make in session. These assignments were Timeline of a day (Day1), key moments in life (Day2) (e.g. first part-time job), Close relatives \u0026amp; peers (Day3), Activities online/offline (Day4), Banking touch points (Day5) and Imaging future (Day6).\n3. Generative Session\nA 3-hour generative session was held to gain insights.\nIcebreaker: Participants received chocolate coins, and were asked to \u0026lsquo;spend\u0026rsquo; money to hanging envelopes that represents various spending categories. It was clearly seen that the youngsters spent pocket money mainly on food and clothings.\nTimeline: The youngsters were asked to visualise 1 to 3 key moments from sensitising booklet. These moments were placed on a timeline, and defined by people, place and moment itself. Sports, hobbies, holidays and \u0026lsquo;first time\u0026rsquo; experience were mostly marked. Those moments were shared with family/friends and paid by parents/grandparents. Money seems invisible for participants.\nIdeal banking: To realise their ideal banking service, participants were asked to build a prototype to demonstrate ideas. The tangible output will provide the design direction for ABN AMRO bank. However, the needs addressed by teens like checking account balance, saving for sports/hobbies and keeping money safe were already offered by ABN AMRO banking service.\n4. Analysis: The dialogues from session were transcribed and clustered into themes like parental strategy, financial attitude, bank touchpoint, etc.\nThe persona grid mapped out the relevant differences between youngsters in relation to financial attitudes and parental strategy were created to form 4 persona groups from 8 participants\nWe also created wallets as tangible deliverables to provide rich content related to persona\u0026rsquo;s personality. 5. Communication A internal session was held to make our ABN AMRO client be more familiar with our research result. Personas, wallets and life journeys were given as materials for brainstorming, answering the ideal moments, appropriate media and suggested activity to engage the youngsters with banking service.\nThis project is partnered with ABN AMRO Bank, TU Delft \u0026amp; MUZUS.\n","permalink":"https://imogenchen.github.io/work/contextampping_for_youngster/","tags":["Collaborative Workshop "],"title":"Contextmapping for Young Money"},{"categories":["User Research"],"contents":"Role in Team: Field Study, User Research, Design Strategy \u0026amp; Business Model Canvas\nIntroduction 2.5 billion people, roughly 37% of world population are lack of affordable and safe sanitation system. Open defecation results in numbers of children\u0026rsquo;s death in the early age by intaking polluted drinking water from rivers. In 2011, Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gate Foundation launched \u0026lsquo;Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\u0026rsquo;, seeking a bottom-of-pyramid concept to fight hygienic problem in developing countries.\nTU Delft tackle this challenge in collaboration with the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering and the department of Process and Energy. The response to Reinvent the Toilet project is a combination of advanced technology and user-centred design. I am very lucky to being part of team, to deliver a human-centred approach based on plasma gasification, a technology upgrades human waste into energy.\n  Challenge How might we design a self-sustainable and community-based sanitation that are accessible and economical to slum dwellers.\nSolution Running a sustainable sanitation business model by constructing a membership facility equipped by water diverting toilet, and transporting human waste to plasma gasification plant, to convert organic matter into synthesis gas for environmental-friendly.\nProcess 1. Ethnographic Research In 2013 spring, we flew to Ahmedabad City in India for two-month field study. Together with local nonprofit Sulabh International, we took culture lens to study of slum dwellers' and rural residents' lives.\nWe initiated our research by surveying the situations of private house-hold toilets and shared community sanitation, which allowed us to realise the ground realities of sanitation in slums and rural areas. Furthermore, we had conversation with former environmental officials, rural inhabitants and slum dwellers in Ramapir/Gulbai Tekra to understand the their attitude to hygiene from diverse perspectives.\nOur investigation found the presence of public sanitation in urban slums doesn\u0026rsquo;t ensure the usage to all while it is hundred meters distant from the most household and requested paying to enter. As for rural area, partly household lacked access to toilets and had to practise open defecation. Slum dwellers expected easy-to-use sanitation with holistic management to ensure the safety, accessibility and cleanliness.\n2. Design Strategy: To make our new design sustainable and fit into local using behaviours, we framed 4 key rules to innovate sanitation system:\n Following traditional cleaning methods by using bucket of water to flush squatting pan after use. Taking advantage of ubiquitous tempo trucks as vehicle to transport human waste containers to plasma gasification plant. To leverage economical and hygienic concerns, one sanitation facility is suggested to be shared by 5 to 7 families. Offering water-diverting squatting pans with ergonomic stepping areas for a safe toilet usage and water management.  3. Water-Diverting Toilet To collect human waste for plasma gasification process, we redesigned squatting pan into a water diverting toilet that avoid solids from trespassing to water pipe. Through experimental prototype phase, a critical angle of the slope is finally confirmed to make sure the diverting effectiveness.\n4. Business Model Canvas Our sanitation system are accessible for slum families who join the membership. The business design is partnered by nonprofit Sulabh International fundraising, investment from Reckitt Benckiser,the largest hygienic consumer goods company in India, and Tata Motor for running the transportation business and hiring local man-power. Plasma gasification plant will be built by Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Foundation.\nThis project is partnered with Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gate Foudation \u0026amp; TU Delft.\n","permalink":"https://imogenchen.github.io/work/reinvent_the_toilet_in_india/","tags":["Social Innovation","Ethnography","In-Depth Interview","Business Model Canvas"],"title":"Reinvent the Toilet in India"}]
